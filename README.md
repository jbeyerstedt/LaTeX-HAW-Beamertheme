This is an example for LaTeX Beamer presentations inspired by the 2017 Corporate Design of the Hochschule f√ºr Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg (HAW Hamburg).

## Important Version Info
These slides look different in any beamer version after beamer.r43073.
I don't know why, but in beamer.r43073 and older the footer section behaves differently than in the newer versions of beamer.
Currently the old version will produce the correct output to keep compatibility with Overleaf.
